      <h1>What we do</h1>
      <p className="p1">
        QuanTUM is the first Hedgefund society founded at Germanys #1
        university. <br />
        TUM has the brightest minds in fields including Mathematics, Computer
        Science, Engineering, Physics and Business.
        <br /> When founding QuanTUM, we had three things in mind:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Your major does not matter.</h3>
      <p>We believe that true diversity comes from having diverse minds. </p>

      <h3>2. You do not need any prior knowledge in finance</h3>
      <p>
        Breakthroughs happen through novel approaches; <br />
        which often come from people who have not worked in the respective field
        before.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Your age does not matter.</h3>
      <p>
        You could be in the first year of your studies or in a Ph.D. program.
        <br /> We are interested in your personality.
        <br /> Still, having expertise in certain fields might help
        significantly.
