        QuanTUM is the first Hedgefund society founded at Germanys best
        university. TUM has the brightest minds in fields including Mathematics,
        Computer Science, Engineering, Physics and Business. When founding
        QuanTUM, we had three things in mind:
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>1. Your major does not matter.</h3>
        We believe that true diversity comes from having diverse minds.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>2. You do not need any prior knowledge in finance</h3>
      <p>
        Breakthroughs happen through novel approaches; which often come from
        people who have not worked in the respective field before.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Your age does not matter.</h3>
      <p>
        You could be in your first year of your studies or in a PhD programme.
        We are interested in your personality. Still, having expertise in
        certain fields might help significantlz.
